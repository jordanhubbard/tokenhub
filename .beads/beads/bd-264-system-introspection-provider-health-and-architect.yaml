title: 'System Introspection: Provider Health and Architecture Review'
description: |-
    You are the Engineering Manager for tokenhub, an LLM token routing proxy. Your task:

    1. Read docs/ directory to understand the tokenhub architecture
    2. Run `curl -s http://tokenhub:8888/health` to check tokenhub health
    3. Check provider status by reading any config or status files available
    4. Review LESSONS.md for any accumulated insights

    Then write a brief health report to docs/TOKENHUB_HEALTH_REPORT.md covering:
    - Current system health status
    - Any providers that appear misconfigured or unhealthy
    - Top 3 recommendations for improvement

    Commit and push the report when done.
